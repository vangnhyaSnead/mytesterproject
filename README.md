Hello there! If you are seeing this, this is a project that i am using for myself improvement.
Here I will be working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and other languages that you will see while looking at my repo. 
It would be nice if you could help me improve, sending pull requests or commenting explaning me a better way to code. 

Thank you very much!
